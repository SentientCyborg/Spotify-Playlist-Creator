# Spotify-Playlist-Creator
This program scrapes the Billboard Top 100 for a specific date, and then creates a Spotify playlist of the top 100 songs from that day, if they are available.



## You must authenticate with Spotify before this code will work.
The easiest way is to authenticate with Python is via the Spotipy library.

See the Spotipy docs for more info:
